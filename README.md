# UFO Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage for the client Dana.
Dana had data on UFO Sightings and wanted her website to allow users to search for sightings matching specific criteria.
For example, a user may be interested in all data regarding their state.
## Results 
By default the page shows all UFO sightings in chronological order. 
Users can put specific search criteria into the respective search areas text boxes.

The table created is able to successfully filter based on user search inputs. 
Below is an example of user searching by City.

The site also is capable of filtering for multiple criteria at the same time:

## Analysis
The site successfully allows user's to search for specific UFO sightings.
One drawback is the table does not have sort options.
Users may want to sort by duration length.
This would allow individuals to quickly see sightings based on their duration.
Additional improvements could be to allow searching for states by their complete name whereas currently they must search by state abbreviation.
Further improvements may allow users to search for comments.
For example, a user may want to search for comments that used the word "flickering" to find information on sightings of such manner.
